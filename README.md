# Timetable-Management-System
The university timetable system automates scheduling, optimizing class and resource allocation, minimizing conflicts, and enhancing overall efficiency in academic operations.
The Time Table Management System (TTMS) is a comprehensive web application designed for universities, utilizing PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an efficient and user-friendly scheduling solution. This system automates the complex task of timetable creation and management, enhancing the overall organization of academic schedules.

TTMS offers a seamless interface, allowing administrators to easily input and modify course information, faculty availability, and classroom resources. The PHP backend ensures robust data handling, while MySQL serves as the database management system for secure and scalable storage. The HTML and CSS front-end components contribute to an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, facilitating easy navigation and interaction.

The system's dynamic features enable real-time updates, reducing scheduling conflicts and optimizing resource allocation. JavaScript enhances interactivity, providing a responsive and dynamic interface for users. The repository on GitHub contains the complete source code, offering a foundation for deployment and further customization. The README file guides users through the setup process, ensuring a smooth implementation of the TTMS. This project represents an innovative solution for universities seeking a modern, technology-driven approach to streamline their timetable management processes.
